What is a Network?
Network is a group of interconnected nodes or computing devices that exchange data and resources with each other.
what is a Computing device?
   Computing Devices are any Electronic devices able to perform computations or performing tasks
Realtime explanation...
Imagine an office containing multiple computers, printers, and servers interconnected with each other to share data and resources

major components:
   major components of a network enables the devices to exchange data and resources with each other with in the network
* switch 
* hub
* NIC 
* bridge 
* server 
* modem 
* router 
* repeater

Switch :
Switch is a device that connects Various Systems device that Connects in a network fo form local Area network. when one device Communicates with other,the switch helps in directing the - message Specifically to the target device .Switch Contains multiple ports. Switch have a database of source Address and destination Address called MAC Address (media Access Control)

Hub:
A hub is a basic networking device that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other. Hubs receive data packets from one device and broadcast them to all the other devices connected to the hub.It is less expensive.It performs small job.It is used to form a small network.

NIC:
A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that allows a computer or other device to connect to a network. It's commonly found in computers and provides the physical interface between the device and the network medium.

Bridge:
 In networking, a bridge is a device or software component that connects two or more network segments or LANs (Local Area Networks), essentially creating a larger network. 

Server:
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Modem:
A modem is a network device that both modulates and demodulates analog carrier signals (called sine waves) for encoding and decoding digital information for processing.

Router:
-is a network device that forwards packets between computer networks
-it is at  3 layer or network layer of osi model
-it manages traffic between layers while forwarding
-Allows multiple devices to use same network
